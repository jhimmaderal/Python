      "interpreters in the late 1950s and remains a popular way to interact\n",
      "with dynamic languages such as Python.\n",
      "However, like most such command prompts, the standard\n",
      "Python prompt is a text-only environment. Commands are entered\n",
      "by the user, parsed, and executed, with results displayed as text.\n",
      "This offers immediate feedback and works well for data that is\n",
      "naturally expressed in a concise textual form. Unfortunately, this\n",
      "approach begins to fail when the data cannot be usefully visualized\n",
      "as text, as is typical for the large datasets now commonplace.\n",
      "In such instances, a separate plotting package offering a rich\n",
      "graphical display would normally be used to present the results\n",
      "outside the environment of the interpreter, via a graphical user\n",

      "peared long before any graphical interfaces. To this day, text-only\n",

      "At the same time as text-based interpreters have failed to overcome\n",
      "the inherent limitations of working with rich data, the web browser\n",
      "has emerged as a ubiquitous means of interactively working with\n",

      "user for immediate feedback without requiring additional code.Although this concept is familiar and intuitive when interactively\n",
      "working with simple data types, it is worth reviewing explicitly\n",

      "these ideas is clear.\n",
      "When executing an addition operation like 1 + 2.5 at a\n",
      "Python prompt, the expression is parsed, converted into bytecode,\n",
      "and then executed, resulting in the ﬂoat value 3.5. This ﬂoating-\n",
      "point value is immediately returned to the user in the appropriate\n",
      "displayable representation, giving the user immediate feedback.\n",
      "Of course, this representation is not the ﬂoat itself, but the\n",
      "string\"3.5\" . Such strings are automatically generated by the\n",
      "interpreter, via the displayed object’s __repr__ method.\n",
      "The Python interpreter also provides such automatic, immedi-\n",
      "ate feedback for more complex data types like large NumPy arrays,\n",
      "but for such data the displayed string has very little utility because\n",
      "it is either incomplete or impractical. In a terminal, this restriction\n",
      "is a result of the __repr__ method only supporting a text-based\n",
      "display value. Using HoloViews in the IPython Notebook, you\n",
      "can give your array a more useful, interpretable default visual\n",
      "representation as an image, curve, or similar plot according to the\n",
      "following principles:\n",
      "•It must be easy to assign a useful and understandable\n",
      "default representation to your data. The goal is to keep\n",
      "the initial barrier to productivity as low as possible -- data\n",
      "should simply reveal itself.\n",
      "•These atomic data objects (elements) should be almost\n",
      "trivially simple wrappers around your data, acting as\n",
      "proxies for the contained arrays along with a small amount\n",
      "of semantic metadata (such as whether the user thinks of\n",
      "some particular set of data as a continuous curve or as a\n",
      "discrete set of points).\n",
      "•Any metadata included in the element must address issues\n",

      "tings should be stored and implemented entirely separately\n",
      "from the content elements, so that elements can be gener-\n",
      "ated, archived, and distributed without any dependencies\n",
      "on the visualization code.\n",
      "•As the principles above force the atomic elements to be\n",
      "simple, they must then be compositional in order to build\n",
      "complex data structures that reﬂect the interrelated plots\n",
      "typical of publication ﬁgures.\n",

      "Although the names of the Elements suggest that these\n",
      "objects are about visualization, they are primarily concerned with\n",

      "a convenient way to intuitively understand the dimensionality of\n",
      "the data in terms of an appropriate visual representation. For\n",

      "The particular Image shown in Figure 1 Awas constructed\n",
      "as a visualization of the Mandelbrot Set, deﬁned in the complex\n",

      "with dynamic languages such as Python.\n",

      "Python prompt is a text-only environment. Commands are entered\n",
      "by the user, parsed, and executed, with results displayed as text.\n",
      "This offers immediate feedback and works well for data that is\n",
      "naturally expressed in a concise textual form. Unfortunately, this\n",
      "approach begins to fail when the data cannot be usefully visualized\n",
      "as text, as is typical for the large datasets now commonplace.\n",
      "In such instances, a separate plotting package offering a rich\n",
      "graphical display would normally be used to present the results\n",
      "outside the environment of the interpreter, via a graphical user\n",
      "interface.\n",
